            For the entire weekend we will host multiple 1 to 1.5 hour time
            slots with maximum groups of four people per session. This helps
            people stay safe, and also allows players to get more one-on-one
            coaching during their session.

          <p className="my-2 text-center">
            During each session we will assess playersâ€™ throwing form and take
            them through a progression of drills and explanations that will help
            build more efficient mechanics.

            Players will gain new knowledge about throwing mechanics, learn
            about the specific parts of their own technique that they can
            improve upon, and become equipped with simple drills to develop
            their skills.
